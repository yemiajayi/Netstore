# Source code

This folder should include the following:

1. Source code of your django web application
2. A **requirements** file to specify which version of different libraries you have used.
3. The **email backend** in the project settings should be set to: django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
4. All html pages should be properly connected so one can navigate easily in the application.
5. Django Admin must only be used for debugging purposes.
